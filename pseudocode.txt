    "Real-Time Inequality" presents a new methodology offering timely and high-frequency estimates of income distribution in the U.S. This method integrates various public data sources into a unified framework, with retrospective validation back to 1976.

    The significance of real-time analysis in income distribution is paramount. By tracking the distributional impacts of government policies in real-time, we gain insights for data-informed policy decisions.
